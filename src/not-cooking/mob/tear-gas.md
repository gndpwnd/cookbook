# Tear Gas

### Directions

1. Chop up 1 lb. of dried red or green peppers. Throw away stems but try to retain as many veins and seeds as possible (where the OC oil is most concentrated).

2. Blend peppers in a blender or crush using a pestle.

3. Add enough denatured ethyl alcohol (vodka will work in a pinch) to cover the peppers.

4. Place the contents in a pan.

5. Place the pan in another pan of water. Do not heat the ethyl alcohol mixture directly and keep it away from flames. Alcohol fumes can easily ignite and cause serious injury.

6. Heat the water, then allow it to cool.

7. Repeat this process three times.

8. Pour the alcohol off into a glass jar (leaving the peppers behind).

9. Heat the alcohol until it evaporates to about 100 milliliter.

10. Filter off any residual grains or pepper seeds.

11. Place mixture in an open container and allow to evaporate overnight.

### With Vinegar

Mix chopped-up peppers with white vinegar in a bowl.
Store the mixture in the refrigerator overnight. The vinegar will leach out the capsicum.
Add water and mix well.

## How to use

**Pepper spray bomb**

Tear gas can be placed in a breakable glass container and thrown to disperse the gas. First, cut down (dilute) the tear gas mixture with mineral oil. Use a ratio of 5% pepper oil and 95% mineral oil.

Place the mixture in a glass container. Perfume bottles make excellent distribution devices.

Throw the container to disperse the gas. Make sure you test in an open area with plenty of ventilation. Once thrown, you can slowly approach the container until you begin to feel the effects of the tear gas.

**Spray bottles**

Pepper spray can be dispersed from spray bottles too. This method is good for close quarter distribution but of course, is riskier to the attacker. Nasal spray bottles work well and are portable and easy to carry in your pocket. Large spray canisters, the ones you use for bug spray, are extremely effective but unwieldy to transport.

## What to do if attacked with tear gas

- Close eyes and hold breath for as long as possible.
- Move out of the area to higher ground or upwind from the gas source.
- Cover your mouth with a rag soaked with water.
- If you wear contact lenses, remove them immediately.
- Remove clothes and air them out.
- Rinse skin with cold water and soap.
- Rinse eyes with copious amounts of water.
