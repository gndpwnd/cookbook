# Simple Smoke Bombs

> a 200 gram mixture makes about 3-4 smoke bombs that are 6in tall by 2in diameter

### Ingredients

* 12 parts KNO3 (stump remover)
* 10 parts Paraphine Wax
* 8 parts Powdered Sugar

### Equipment

* Knife (utility knife works best)
* Cooking Pan (preferrably for an outdoor setting)
* Hot plate / Electric stove
* Blender / Coffee Grinder
* Popsicle Sticks / Disposable Mixing Hardware
* Epoxy OR Wood Putty
* Red Solo Cups (or any disposable mixing container)
* Sections of pipe (cardboard craft tubes are preferred, but PVC works)
* Duct Tape Tape
* Drill & 3/8in drill bit
* Pyro Fuse (commercial or homemade works)


### Directions

* Prep your sections of pipe
    * Pro Tip: dremel 1-2 rings at both ends of each section of pip so your sealent has a better grip
    * tape off one end of each pipe section so no liquid can escape
    * fill up the pip (with tape side down) about a 1/2in with sealent
        * if using expoxy, mix epoxy before hand
        * if using wood putty, mix putty befor hand
        * this is where the red solo cups come in handy
    * tap the section of pip (with tape side down) on a flat surface to remove air bubbles in sealant
    * let sealant dry
* Heat up the pan and start melting your Wax
    * If you have wax bars, use the knife to cut into smaller pieces beforehand
    * Low and slow (patience) is the name of game
    * you don't want to see smoke, this means your wax is evaporating
* Add KN03 to blender/Grinder
    * blend until you get a fine powder
    * before opening the blender/grinder, wait a couple of minuts to let the fine dust settle 
* Add Powdered Sugar to blender/Grinder (with KNO3 powder)
    * blend for around a minute, tilting the blender every so often to get powder off the bottom
    * before opening the blender/grinder, wait a couple of minuts to let the fine dust settle
* When the wax is completely melted, stir the dry mixture into the pan
    * stir until you get a thick paste
    * Again, low and slow is the name of the game, if the mixture starts to turn brown, its burning
    * if you have any melted wax left over, pour this out of the pan and store this to recycle later
* Pour the smoke mixture into the prepared sections of pipe
    * leave about 1/2in to 1in gap at the top of the pipe section
    * if you dremeled out rings in your pipe sections, then fill up to just below the rings
    * let cool
* Once the smoke mixture is hardened, seal the rest of the pipe section with your exposy or putty
    * let dry
* Drill a 3/8in hole in the top of the pipe section
    * ideally, this hole would reach down to the other end of the pipe where the sealent starts
    * this way more of your smoke mixture is burned more effeciently
* Cut your fuse to the desired length
    * place your fuse in the hole
    * backfill with a 50/50 mix of KN03 to Powdered Sugar
        * don't pack tightly because you want airflow
    * secure the fuse assembly with a very samll piece of cotton stuffed in the top
* In this case, it is healthy to smoke a pack a day. (not medical advice)
