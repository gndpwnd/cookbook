> Should fill a 5 gallon bucket

# Laundry Soap

**Ingredients **_**(Makes 1 Batch, fills a 5 Gallon Bucket)**_

* 1 bar of your normal soap
* 1C of Arm & Hammer super washing soda
* 1/2C Borax

**Directions for Creating a Storage Mix**

* Heat 4C of water in a pot
* Add ingredients into the pot, stirring constantly so it does not boil over
* Once everything is dissolved, mix for thoroughness and remove from the heat
* Fill a 5-gallon bucket with water
* Stir in soap compound
* Mix thoroughly (suggest using a drill with a mixing attachment)
* Fill a 5-gallon bucket the rest of the way with water
* Mix again and store

**Directions for Creating a Normal-Use Mix**

* It is recommended to dilute the Storage Mix for use on fabrics that touch the skin
* Fill a 1-gallon container 1/3 of the way full with the Storage Mix
* Fill the rest of the 1-gallon container with warm water
  * The water should be about uncomfortable to touch
  * Too cold and the soap will not mix well, and washing will be uneven
  * Too hot and it will form a gel that will not be as effective when washing
* Shake 1-gallon container to create the Laundry Soap for Normal Use
